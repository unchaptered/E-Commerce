## 1. Introduce



### 1.1. Get Started

Now, preparing...
### 1.2. Goals of proejct

This project, **e-commerce-be**, is created to archive these goals.<br>

- [ ] Build Serverless Microservices Architecture 
    - [x] Use API Gateway
    - [x] Use Lambda
    - [x] Use DynamoDB
    - [ ] Use EventBus
    - [ ] Use SQS
- [ ] Set-up Serverless deploy, developement, testing system.
    - [x] Deploy system with AWS CDK
    - [ ] Development system with AWS SAM
    - [ ] Testing system with Jest, MockEvent.

### 1.3. Release History

| Release         | Descdription                             |

## 2. Stacks (+ reason)

***This Section deal with technical decision and its reason.***

As a server developer, reasons for technical decision is very important.<br>
Many develoepr say about **important things for good server**.<br>

Representatively, it's `Scalability`, `Reliability`, `Maintencance` and so on.<br>
And I think `efficiency` and `timeliness` should be included in it.<br>

In business, all developement activiteis consume time and money.<br>
In extreme perspective, time is equaled to money, so every activity consume money.<br>
That is **why developer consider input and output as possible as efficiency** for business. <br>

> This is a very personal opinion. <br>
> However, many of them cited references including official documents.
